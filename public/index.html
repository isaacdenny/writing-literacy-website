            <strong>Ask ChatGPT</strong> for the best way to learn a skill. You
            might receive suggestions like focused practice and active learning,
            or perhaps repetition and consistency. What our AI helpers do not
            know is that they are inhibiting the learning ability of an entire
            generation of programmers. Unfortunately, many LLM users outsource
            their essay-writing, email-writing, programming, or even texting to
            the virtual assistant without a second thought. Climbing out of the
            addictive, vicious cycle that is asking ChatGPT for help with
            writing code was my biggest challenge when learning to code in my
            first year of college.

            <strong>I had no understanding of what I was writing.</strong> The
            first semester of my freshman year mostly involved gawking at coding
            challenges on LeetCode, trying my best to design algorithms to solve
            them, and inevitably asking ChatGPT for help when I hit an obstacle.
            Many nights I sat in my dark, honors dorm room at Boise State
            University, Idaho and struggled with the difficult principles of
            computer science. As far as I could tell, AI frequently answered my
            low-difficulty questions correctly; countless bugs would sneak under
            my inexperienced radar. It was a formula for poorly-written,
            untested code that kept me coming back for more.

          <div class="chat-msg ai">

            >
            As I scrolled through the impressive resume projects of job-crushing
            college-grads and freelance workaholics alike, I shook at the sheer
            number of work-hours necessary to complete such tasks without
            assistance. I frequently found myself questioning my ability without
            an AI assistant backing my play, but deep down I knew if I wanted to
            get any good at programming, I needed to take a step away from
            prompting.

            My fiance and I wanted a website to announce our wedding and
            register guests: this seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn
            how to build a website from scratch, without ChatGPT. Contrary to
            popular understanding of computer scientists, I need sunlight to
            write code. I much preferred the bright, floor-to-ceiling-windowed
            common room in the honors dorm building at BSU to my small,
            dimly-lit dorm room and reserved roommate. That is where I built my
            first website: a simple registration form for my wedding in June of
            2023. The feeling of accomplishment was my own; it gave me a step
            toward AI independence.

          <div class="chat-msg user-msg-container">
            <div class="user-msg">Surely it's not that simple</div>

            <img
              class="ai-logo"

            <strong
              >The more code I wrote on my own, the more I understood.</strong
            >
            Soon after finishing my wedding website, I received a job building a
            website for a local company, then another job building internal
            tooling. My learning speed increased, and soon I had a basic
            understanding of the principles of programming on the web. For me,
            the project or tool was less important than the ability to build an
            idea and reach a goal without assistance. When I first learned to
            write code, the language server or text editor tools hindered how
            quickly I could pick up a language. Likewise, AI tools like Copilot
            or Tabnine that constantly try to guess what you are thinking while
            you type were counterproductive and unhealthy during my first steps
            away from ChatGPT: it was too easy to get the answer and move on
            without considering if it was bug-infested (and it often was).

          <div class="chat-msg user-msg-container">
            <div class="user-msg">Is this a one-off problem?</div>

              alt="ai-brain"
            />
            <strong>I can see now that I was not alone in my addiction.</strong>
            In each of my middle-to-higher-level classes, many of my classmates
            race to the comforting OpenAI website to ask for solutions to their
            problems, or help building out a project as I once did. As more AI
            tools promise to replace programmers, their appeal adds to the
            difficulty of breaking free: why learn to code when an AI tool can
            spit out the correct answer and save you time? I shudder every time
            I remember the many long hours staring at error messages and fixing
            bugs without a second robotic opinion, but those late-night coding
            sessions fueled my learning. Even though my projects were often
            unfinished and lost to the depths of my computerâ€™s hard drive, their
            invaluable lesson was never lost to me: do it yourself.

            >
            and while it is powerfully tempting to ask ChatGPT to write
            everything for me, the side-effect of losing all ability to write is
            too costly. I can write for hours at a time to build out an idea or
            see a project through, but, as you have seen, I did not start that
            way. Learning to write code has been one of the most influential and
            empowering experiences of my life and career, and continues to be as
            I write more. At the simplest level, it has given me a greater
            respect for the systems our society has created, the systems we use
            every day.
